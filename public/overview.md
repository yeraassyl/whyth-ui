## Overview

1.  **Lesson Creation by Teachers:** Teachers can design and create lessons on various topics and configure AI chat. Upon completion, they will receive a unique lessonID and link for joining the lesson.
    
2.  **Lesson Access by Students:** Using a link or a lessonID provided by their teacher, students can initiate a learning session. This opens up an interactive AI chat interface that is custom-tailored to the specific lesson.
    
3.  **AI-Assisted Learning:** Once a session is initiated, students can interact with the AI, asking questions and seeking explanations related to the lesson. The AI, using its advanced language model capabilities, provides responses that aim to clarify doubts, explain concepts in different ways, and assist in the learning process overall.
