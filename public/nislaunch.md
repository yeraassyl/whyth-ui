# üè´ NIS Launch

Dear NIS community,

I am excited to introduce an application that aims to enhance the learning experience by making AI more accessible to schools. The core feature of the application is that it allows teachers to create tailored lessons that students can then engage with using an AI chat interface. 

By integrating AI into the learning process, schools will aim to facilitate a better understanding of complex concepts, encourage self-paced learning, and foster an environment of interactive and experiential learning.

This app promises to make learning more enjoyable and meaningful, and I believe that it can transform the classroom experience. To further improve your experience, please tell us about your experience in this [google form](https://forms.gle/7QUkKNGkHvKimdak9).

Btw, the project is non-profit, [open-source](https://github.com/yeraassyl/whyth) and completely free to use.




*Best Regards,*

## Overview

1.  **Lesson Creation by Teachers:** Teachers can design and create lessons on various topics and configure AI. Upon completion, they will receive a unique lessonID and link for joining the lesson.
    
2.  **Lesson Access by Students:** Using a link or a lessonID provided by their teacher, students can initiate a learning session. This opens up an interactive AI chat interface that is custom-tailored to the specific lesson.
    
3.  **AI-Assisted Learning:** Once a session is initiated, students can interact with the AI, asking questions and seeking explanations related to the lesson. The AI, using its advanced language model capabilities, provides responses that aim to clarify doubts, explain concepts in different ways, and assist in the learning process overall.
