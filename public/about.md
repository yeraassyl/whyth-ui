# ü™ê About us

We are **non-profit**.

Hoping to bring AI a step closer to the masses with this one.

We are currently on a waitlist for the GPT-4 API, as soon as we are in, the AI chat will work even better, that means even more control over AI for a teacher!
* AI will be more focused on a topic
* AI won't give out answers if told so by teacher
* AI assistant for a teacher!
